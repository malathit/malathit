I currently working on developing scalable, reliable, fast, bug-free REST APIs. I also work closely with Kubernetes as my current work involves automating the team's deployments in K8s. In my past work, I worked on big data for a while.

I am curious and would be happy to learn new things that excites me. You can ask me about spring-boot, java, mysql, hibernate, kubernetes.

In my free time, I blog about things I learnt in the hope that it will help someone in future ðŸ˜„ in my website link below.
